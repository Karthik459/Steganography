# Steganography
Steganography in C involves hiding data, such as text or images, within another file, like an image or audio, without altering its visible properties. The project encodes secret data into the least significant bits (LSB) of a carrier file, ensuring imperceptibility. It includes functions for encoding, decoding, and ensuring data integrity.
1.Encoding (Hiding the Message):

->Embed a secret message into an image or text file without significantly altering the appearance or functionality of the carrier file.
->For image-based steganography, modify the least significant bits (LSBs) of pixel values to encode the message.
->For text-based steganography, insert hidden characters or manipulate white spaces in a way that conveys the message without detection.

2.Decoding (Extracting the Message):

->Extract the hidden message from the modified file by reversing the encoding process.
->Validate the extracted message for correctness.
3.File Operations:

->Read and write binary or text data to/from files.
->Handle error cases such as file corruption or invalid inputs.
4.User Interface:

->Provide a command-line interface for the user to choose between encoding and decoding.
->Allow the user to specify the carrier file, the message, and the output file name.
