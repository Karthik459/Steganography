# Steganography
Steganography in C involves hiding data, such as text or images, within another file, like an image or audio, without altering its visible properties. The project encodes secret data into the least significant bits (LSB) of a carrier file, ensuring imperceptibility. It includes functions for encoding, decoding, and ensuring data integrity.
